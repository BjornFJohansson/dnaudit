DNAUDIT is a software tool that verifies cloning strategies expressed as text files using a very light markup.
This format is identical to the one produced by some of the [pydnaweb](https://github.com/BjornFJohansson/pydnaweb?tab=readme-ov-file#pydnaweb) tools.

This is under development and does not work yet.
