Hi and thanks for all the help.

I have replaced my old code with one based on pydivsufsort common_substring.
One single test failed and I made a minimal example (in attach).

Basically, for some reason pydivsufsort common_substring only returned three results although
several more are present.

We published pydna in 2015, and I think that speeding it up together with some other improvements like:

- Adding Golden gate cloning simulation
- Adding Gateway cloning simulation
- Exposing some functionality online

could warrant a second publication.

I wonder if you would be willing to be a co-author by writing a paragraph or two on how and why the new code makes
finding common substrings faster?

All the best,
BjÃ¶rn
